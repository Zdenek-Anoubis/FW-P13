# FW-P13
Hello :)

Here is my first attempt at a design for a 3D printable lower chassis for the Framework 13. It was my first CAD project, so I’m sure it has many issues. One that stands out to me is the thickness of the side walls, which in a few sections is 0.8mm, although, maybe it would be okay with a fibre reinforced filament or something. Another thing: the hinge won’t open the full 180 degrees, although, a minor revision could make that possible. Finally, it might be a tight fit depending on the material properties of the filament and shrinkage, as I unfortunately haven’t had the opportunity to test it myself. The case is designed to use [these](https://www.ruthex.de/en/collections/gewindeeinsatze/products/ruthex-gewindeeinsatz-m2-70-stuck-rx-m2x4-messing-gewindebuchsen) M2 heat inserts for all the screws aside from the hinges, which use [these](https://www.ruthex.de/en/collections/gewindeeinsatze/products/ruthex-gewindeeinsatz-m2-5-70-stuck-rx-m2-5x5-7-messing-gewindebuchsen) M2.5 inserts, and it should be compatible with the standard keyboard and display assemblies.

I’ve borrowed extensively from the [official motherboard case design](https://www.printables.com/model/294573-3d-printable-mainboard-case) (expansion card slots/motherboard tray/m.2 mount/etc.), and also a little bit from the [Framework Tablet Conversion project](https://www.printables.com/model/253923-framework-tablet-conversion) (the middle bar in the frame, and battery/speaker screw dimensions), as I don’t have my own Laptop to base dimensions from. Outside of this, the model is my own creation. In the FreeCad file included in the repository, there is [these](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13/tree/main/Hinges) official hinges included for measurement only, but they are not part of the model.

I do hope this can serve as some inspiration for others to design some cool custom Framework chassis or form factors. All things considered, I’m reasonably happy with the result, but any and all feedback is welcome as I do hope to iterate and improve this further. Please find the discussion on the Framework Forum about this project [here](https://community.frame.work/t/3d-printable-framework-13-chassis-design/79715).

Warm Wishes,
